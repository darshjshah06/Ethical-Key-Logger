# Ethical Keylogger

This project is an **ethical keylogger** designed for **personal use**, such as parental control, self-monitoring, or accessibility tools. It logs keystrokes and saves them to a file while ensuring responsible and legal usage.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This script should **only** be used with full consent and in compliance with legal regulations. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

## Features
✅ Logs all keystrokes, including special keys (Shift, Enter, Backspace, etc.).  
✅ Runs in the background and records timestamps.  
✅ Stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.  
✅ Stores logs securely in a file (`keystrokes.log`).  
✅ Lightweight and easy to use.
